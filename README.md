0# Beatles Loops

## Objectives

* Build a for loop
* Build a while loop
* Build a do-while loop

## Instructions

Make sure you run the tests with `learn`.

1. Create a function `theBeatlesPlay`, which accepts two parameters--an array of
   musicians and an array of instruments. 

    * Create a variable with an empty array.
    * Use a `for loop`, which iterates over the array of musicians. Be careful
      about what value you set your `counter` variable to store. (Hint: Think
      about what the first index of an array is). 
    * The first time through the loop, it should create a string using the _first_
      index of the musicians array **and** the first index of the instruments
      array: `"John Lennon plays guitar"`. 
    * Add this string to the empty array you created. The loop should make the
      same sentence for every member of the musicians array. 
    * The function should return the array of new strings containing what
      instruments each musician plays.

2. Create a function `johnLennonFacts`. 

    * This function will accept one argument, an array of facts about John
      Lennon (note that it might not be exactly the following facts):

    ```js
    const facts = [
      "He was the last Beatle to learn to drive",
      "He was never a vegetarian",
      "He was a choir boy and boy scout",
      "He hated the sound of his own voice"
    ];
    ```

    * Use a while loop to loop over the facts array and add `"!!!"` to the end of
    every fact.

    * Return an array of strings with exclamation points.

3. Create a function `iLoveTheBeatles` which accepts a number as a parameter. 

    * The function should create a variable that stores an empty array. 
    * Implement a do-while loop inside the function that adds `"I love the
      Beatles!"` to the empty array. 
    * The loop should then increment the number passed in as a parameter. The
      condition of the loop should check to see that the parameter number is
      less than `15`. It should contain a number of strings that represents the
      difference between the input number and `15`.
    * Return the array with the strings `"I love the Beatles!"`.
