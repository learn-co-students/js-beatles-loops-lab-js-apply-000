# Beatles Loops

## Objectives

+ Build a for loop
+ Build a while loop
+ Build a do-while loop

## Instructions

Make sure you run the tests with `learn`.


+ Create a function `theBeatlesPlay`, which accepts two parameters- an array of
musicians and an array of instruments. The body of the function should create an
empty array stored in a variable. The function should also contain a for loop
which loops over the array of musicians. You'll want to be careful about what
value you set your counter variable to store. (Hint: Think about what the first
index of an array is). The first time through the loop, the body of the loop
should create a string using the first index of the musicians array and the
first index of the instruments array: `"John Lennon plays guitar"`. This string
should be added to the empty array you created. The loop should make the same
sentence for every member of the musicians array. The function should return the
array of new strings.

+ Create a function `johnLennonFacts`. This function will accept one argument, an
array of facts about John Lennon (note that it might not be exactly the
following facts):

```js
function johnLennonFacts(facts) {
  

const facts = [
  "He was the last Beatle to learn to drive",
  "He was never a vegetarian",
  "He was a choir boy and boy scout",
  "He hated the sound of his own voice"
];

}
```

Use a while loop to loop over the facts array and add `"!!!"` to the end of
every fact. The function should return an array of strings with exclamation
points.

+ Create a function `iLoveTheBeatles` which accepts a number as a parameter. The body of the function should create a variable that stores an empty array. Then, implement a do-while loop inside the function that adds `"I love the Beatles!"`
to the empty array. Then the loop should increment the number passed in as a parameter. The condition of the loop should check to see that the parameter number is less than `15`. The function should return the array with the strings
`"I love the Beatles!"`.
