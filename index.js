1. Create a function theBeatlesPlay, which accepts two parameters--an array of musicians and an array of instruments.
2. Create a variable with an empty array.
3. Use a for loop, which iterates over the array. of musicians. Be careful about what value you set your counter variable to store. (Hint: Think about what the first index of an array is).
4. The first time through the loop, it should create a string using the first index of the musicians array and the first index of the instruments array: "John Lennon plays guitar".
5. Add this string to the empty array you created. The loop should make the same sentence for every member of the musicians array.
6. The function should return the array of new strings containing what instruments each musician plays.*/

1. Create a function johnLennonFacts.
2. This function will accept one argument, an array of facts about John Lennon (note that it might not be exactly the following facts):
3. Use a while loop to loop over the facts array and add "!!!" to the end of every fact.
4. Return an array of strings with exclamation points.*/

1. Create a function iLoveTheBeatles which accepts a number as a parameter.
2. The function should create a variable that stores an empty array.
3. Implement a do-while loop inside the function that adds "I love the Beatles!" to the empty array.
4. The loop should then increment the number passed in as a parameter. The condition of the loop should check to see that the parameter number is less than 15. It should contain a number of strings that represents the difference between the input number and 15.
5. Return the array with the strings "I love the Beatles!".*/
